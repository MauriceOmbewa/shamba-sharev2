# Smart Contract Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Setup

- [ ] **Wallet Setup**
  - [ ] Coinbase Wallet or MetaMask installed
  - [ ] Base Sepolia network added to wallet
  - [ ] Base Sepolia ETH obtained from [faucet](https://www.coinbase.com/faucets/base-ethereum-sepolia-faucet)

- [ ] **Remix IDE Ready**
  - [ ] Opened [remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org)
  - [ ] Created new workspace or using default

## Deployment Steps

- [ ] **Contract Preparation**
  - [ ] Created `contracts/LandListing.sol` in Remix
  - [ ] Copied contract code from `contracts/LandListing.sol`
  - [ ] Set Solidity compiler to version 0.8.19+
  - [ ] Successfully compiled contract (no errors)

- [ ] **Deploy Contract**
  - [ ] Selected "Injected Provider - MetaMask" environment
  - [ ] Confirmed wallet connected to Base Sepolia
  - [ ] Selected LandListing contract
  - [ ] Clicked Deploy button
  - [ ] Confirmed transaction in wallet
  - [ ] Transaction confirmed on blockchain

- [ ] **Post-Deployment**
  - [ ] Copied contract address from Remix
  - [ ] Copied ABI from Solidity Compiler tab
  - [ ] Noted deployment block number
  - [ ] Verified contract appears in Deployed Contracts section

## Contract Information to Save

```
Contract Address: ________________________
Deployment Block: ________________________
Transaction Hash: ________________________
Gas Used: ________________________
Deployment Date: ________________________
```

## Frontend Integration

- [ ] **Update Contract Files**
  - [ ] Updated `src/contracts/DeployedContract.ts` with contract address
  - [ ] Updated `src/contracts/DeployedContract.ts` with ABI
  - [ ] Updated `src/contracts/DeployedContract.ts` with deployment block

- [ ] **Update Hook Integration**
  - [ ] Modified `src/hooks/useLandListings.ts` to use real contract
  - [ ] Uncommented actual contract calls
  - [ ] Commented out or removed mock data

## Testing

- [ ] **Contract Testing in Remix**
  - [ ] Created test listing using `createListing()`
  - [ ] Retrieved listings using `getAvailableListings()`
  - [ ] Tested `getListing()` function
  - [ ] Verified all functions work as expected

- [ ] **Frontend Testing**
  - [ ] Started development server (`npm run dev`)
  - [ ] Connected wallet to app
  - [ ] Tested creating new listings
  - [ ] Tested viewing listings
  - [ ] Tested lease request functionality

## Verification

- [ ] **Block Explorer Verification**
  - [ ] Contract visible on [Base Sepolia Explorer](https://sepolia.basescan.org)
  - [ ] Contract functions are readable
  - [ ] Transactions appear correctly

- [ ] **App Integration Verification**
  - [ ] Real data loads from blockchain
  - [ ] No more mock data being used
  - [ ] All CRUD operations work
  - [ ] Error handling works properly

## Troubleshooting Checklist

If something goes wrong:

- [ ] **Deployment Issues**
  - [ ] Check wallet has sufficient Base Sepolia ETH
  - [ ] Verify connected to Base Sepolia network
  - [ ] Try increasing gas limit
  - [ ] Check Remix console for error messages

- [ ] **Integration Issues**
  - [ ] Verify contract address is correct
  - [ ] Check ABI is complete and properly formatted
  - [ ] Ensure network configuration matches
  - [ ] Check browser console for errors

- [ ] **Transaction Issues**
  - [ ] Confirm wallet is connected
  - [ ] Check transaction status on block explorer
  - [ ] Verify contract state hasn't changed
  - [ ] Try with different gas settings

## Success Criteria

✅ **Deployment Successful When:**
- Contract deployed without errors
- Contract address obtained
- Functions callable in Remix
- Block explorer shows contract

✅ **Integration Successful When:**
- App loads real blockchain data
- Users can create listings
- Users can request leases
- All transactions work properly

## Next Steps After Success

1. **Production Deployment**: Deploy to Base mainnet when ready
2. **Frontend Optimization**: Optimize for better user experience
3. **Additional Features**: Add more advanced features
4. **Security Audit**: Consider security review for mainnet

- Check the `REMIX_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for detailed steps
- Review contract code in `contracts/LandListing.sol`
- Test functions individually in Remix before frontend integration
